A person complained the elevator is arriving a bit slow
The team increased the speed of the elevator with days of coding and work
But the problem was not about the "Speed" but it was about the "Feeling"
So another team solved the problem by simply installing a mirror infront of the elevator so that the users dont feel bored while waiting
This story tells us that realizing what needs to be done is more important than how you do it

I focus on "What" I am trying to solve and who can benefit from that
The approach does not begin until I am clear of what I am trying to achieve
